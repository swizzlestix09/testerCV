          <p>When I was younger I was heavily involved in the arts, particularly fashion illustration & styling myspace pages :) My love for animals made me dedicate 15 years to them,
          primarily working in veterinary & canine behavioral fields. I have minimally worked with Laboratory animals as well. Now, I have dedicated myself to study coding, a lifelong hobby.
          I like to draw, knit and drink coffee. I am hoping to put something positive out there with what I learn that can benefit me and my community.</p>                                                  <!-- like can use 'strong' to bold text, bold will *style* the words bold. -->
